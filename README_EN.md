Objective:
The program implements a genetic algorithm to solve the commuter problem. This problem involves finding the shortest route that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting point. The programme can be used, for example, to plan the installation of an Internet network between given points. 

Meaning of the variables:

headerResult, headerResult2, headerResult3, resultList: Variables storing references to the HTML elements where the results will be displayed.
numPoints: The number of cities.
popSize: The size of the population in the genetic algorithm.
generations: The number of generations of the genetic algorithm.
mutationRate: The mutation rate in the genetic algorithm.
points: An array containing randomly generated points (cities) in the plane.
bestRoute: The best route found in the comovement problem.

Function description:

Function getRandomIntInclusive(min, max).
Generates a random integer from the given range, taking into account the min and max limits.

function createPoints(numPoints)
Generates an array of random points representing cities in the plane with x and y coordinates.

function calcDistance(points, order)
Calculates the distance between cities in the order specified by the order array, using the Euclidean distance formula.

function createOrderPoints(order, points)
Creates an array of x and y points based on the order of the cities defined in the order array.

Function initialPopulation(popSize, numPoints)
Generates the initial population of routes (order of visiting cities) with popSize.

function shuffle(array)
Shuffles the order of elements in the array, used to randomise the order of cities.

function selectParents(population, points)
Selects parents for crossover based on the value of the adaptation function, the inverse of which corresponds to the distance between cities.

function crossover(parents)
Performs crossover of parents to generate offspring.

function mutate(child, mutationRate)
Performs mutation of offspring with a given mutation rate.

function geneticAlgorithm(points, popSize, generations, mutationRate)
Implements a genetic algorithm that solves the comovement problem. Iteratively creates new populations, selects the best route, updates the list of results and returns the best route found.

Calling the genetic algorithm:
The genetic algorithm is run with specific parameters: number of cities (numPoints), population size (popSize), number of generations (generations) and mutation rate (mutationRate). The result, i.e. the best route, is then displayed in specific HTML elements (headerResult2 and headerResult3).

Summary:
The code implements a genetic algorithm to solve the commuter problem. It starts by randomly generating cities in a plane, then iteratively evolves the population of routes, selecting the best solutions. The results are displayed on a web page in specific HTML elements or via the electron framework after typing the comments "npm run start:electron" .
